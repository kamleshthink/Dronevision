 DroneVision

DroneVision is an advanced drone project designed to navigate autonomously using cutting-edge computer vision and reinforcement learning algorithms. It features obstacle detection and avoidance, path planning, and target tracking capabilities, making it ideal for applications in surveillance, inspection, and mapping.

 Features

- Obstacle Detection & Avoidanc: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for real-time obstacle detection and avoidance.
- Path Planning: Implements reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize flight paths.
- Target Tracking: Uses computer vision techniques to track and follow designated targets.
- Autonomous Navigation: Fully autonomous drone navigation with minimal human intervention.
